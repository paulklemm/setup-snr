    "Description": "Embryonic mouse skin samples were halved, one half separated into epidermis and dermis and RNA isolated, and the other half immersed in medium containing Actinomycin D (Act D) to halt transcription. After 30, 60 or 120 minutes at 37 degrees C the Actinomycin D treated samples were separated into epidermis and dermis and RNA isolated from these. Resulting RNA samples were sequenced to quantify transcript abundances.",
